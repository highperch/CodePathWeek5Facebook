# CodePathWeek5Facebook
Demo Facebook app for CodePath iOS for Designers Week 5

This is a walkthrough of iOS Facebook Photos for Week 5's assignment.

Time spent: 6.5 hours spent in total so far

Completed user stories:

 * [x] Tapping on a photo in the news feed should expand the photo full screen.
 * [x] Tapping the Done button should animate the photo back into its position in the news feed.
 * [x] On scroll of the full screen photo, the background should start to become transparent, revealing the feed.
 * [x] If the user scrolls a large amount and releases, the full screen photo should dismiss.
 * [x] Optional: The full screen photo should be zoomable.
 * [x] Optional: The user should be able to page through the other photos in full screen mode.
 
 Notes:
 Full screen zoom is a little buggy...
 Used an IF statement to prevent prepareForSegue code from firing every time another button is pressed (was causing crashing issues)
